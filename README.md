Contextual Real-time Intelligent Typo Identifier & Corrector (CRITIC)

A context-aware spell-check ML System that provides appropriate feedback to the user in real-time after they make an error.

• Address the feedback in your project proposal.

• Add any references, at least you must have a couple of key references.

• If there is a risk, indicate it in your proposal, and a rough plan of how you are going to
mitigate it.
